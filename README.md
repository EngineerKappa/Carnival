# Super Freaks Presents: Swordsmaze

hii uhh, this is a little genesis game I wrote in [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK), starring characters from Super Freaks.

Just kinda leaving this here, read this code at your own peril. There are a few other assets here that never got used for one reason or another.
(Fyi, the levels are just giant arrays. I wrote a separate program in Game Maker to generate them, but I don't feel like releasing that atm)

As far as licensing goes, uhhhhh:
- I don't own anything from Super Freaks, if you want to do anything with those assets you'd probably have to ask SuperFreaksDev
- Don't be a dick
- Barring that you can do whatever you want with the code, I don't really care, but also don't expect me to act as tech support.
- Trans rights are human rights
